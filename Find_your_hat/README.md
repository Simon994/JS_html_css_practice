This is a game where the player has to navigate a 'field' to move their path character to coincide with a 'hat', indicated by a caret symbol.
When a user runs main.js, they are prompted for inputs to specify the size of a field and 'difficulty' which indicates how many holes there will be within the field. 
They are then able to indicate which direction they’d like to move (l, r, d, u). This should continue until the user either: Wins by finding their hat; or Loses by either landing on (and falling in) a hole, or
attempts to move “outside” the field, or runs over their tail.
